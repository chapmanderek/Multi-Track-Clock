Multi-Track-Clock by Derek Chapman
=================
This clock has a very specific usage that I'm hoping others will find useful enough to modify it for their own needs. It is programmed for a Arduino Micro and Real Time Clock.

The problem: My wife's school has 4 tracks (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) with 1 off at all times, 3 different schedules (A-B-C) which rotate amongst the different tracks at different times in the year, and each schedule has different start and end times for the classes. Oh and different grade levels have planning periods at different times.

The solution: This clock will glow with the color of the track that is on break at that time, and has 2 different white lights to display which grade level is off. The clock doesn't actually display the time, instead it automatically keeps track of the web of schedules. Please feel free to use the code as a basis for anything that seems useful to you.
